    "## **Integration with External API**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the movie flat file data from kaggle.com, we utilize the cleaned data titles to fetch additional information from an external movie-related API. This process allows us to enrich our dataset with more detailed data, such as recent reviews, updated ratings, and additional metadata not originally included in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **API Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of data source:** The OMDb API (The Open Movie Database) is a RESTful web service for obtaining movie information. It offers detailed data, including titles, year, ratings, plot descriptions, and poster images for movies and TV series. To expand the dataset, I plan to utilize the movie titles extracted from the 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv' file as search queries for the OMDb API. Subsequently, the movie data obtained from the API will be saved in a new CSV file, systematically amalgamating an extensive compilation of movie metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API used for this purpose is [Movie Information API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). It provides detailed information about movies, including cast details, recent reviews, and audience ratings. This API was chosen for its comprehensive data offerings and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Preparing the Data**\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: We start by ensuring that the movie titles in our dataset are formatted correctly and are suitable for API queries. This involves trimming whitespace and replacing spaces with appropriate characters (e.g., underscores or plus signs) as required by the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: API Requests**\n",
    "- **Sending Requests**: For each movie title, we send a request to the API. The requests are sent using the Python `requests` library. We handle errors and exceptions to ensure that our script is robust against network issues or data discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Data Integration**\n",
    "Integrating API Data: The responses from the API are parsed and integrated with our existing DataFrame. We ensure that the additional data aligns with our dataset's structure and fill in missing values where API responses are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Verify Data Structure for Integration**\n",
    "In this step, we'll conduct a basic metadata check to ensure that the newly cleaned dataset is properly structured for merging with the data cleaned in Milestone 2. This involves verifying the dataset's dimensions, column types, and the presence of key identifiers necessary for a successful merge."

    "### Ethical Implications of Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "When transforming and cleaning this movie dataset, several steps were taken to enhance data quality and usability, including standardizing headers and text formats, parsing JSON fields into readable formats, removing duplicates, and formatting date fields. Such processes are essential to making data analysis tasks more straightforward and ensuring accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Ethical Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Changes**\n",
    "- **Textual Data and Formats**: We standardized textual data and reformatted dates to ensure uniformity and ease of analysis.\n",
    "- **JSON Structures**: Parsing JSON structures makes the data more accessible but may simplify the nuances of data representation.\n",
    "- **Duplicate Removal**: While removing duplicates prevents skewed statistical analyses, it's crucial to ensure that this does not inadvertently remove valid data that appears similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Legal and Regulatory Guidelines**\n",
    "There are no specific legal restrictions for this publicly available dataset. However, general data handling and privacy principles should always be considered to maintain trust and integrity in data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Transformation Risks**\n",
    "- **Over-Cleaning**: There's a risk that over-cleaning might lead to the loss of critical data, particularly with automated processes that remove what appears to be duplicates or outliers without manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assumptions**\n",
    "- **Duplicate Identifiers**: The assumption that duplicate IDs always indicate duplicate entries may not hold if there were errors in data collection or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Sourcing/Credibility**\n",
    "- **Source Credibility**: The dataset was sourced from a public movie database, which is presumed to be credible. However, verification against multiple sources is recommended to enhance data reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ethical Acquisition**\n",
    "- **Public Data**: The dataset is assumed to be ethically sourced, containing publicly available information about movies without any personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mitigation of Risks**\n",
    "- **Transparency and Verification**: Maintain transparency about the data transformations and provide access to the raw data for verification purposes.\n",
    "- **Best Practices**: Regularly update data handling practices to comply with emerging best practices and ethical standards.\n"
